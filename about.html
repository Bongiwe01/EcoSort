        <h2>Why Proper Waste Sorting Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Every day, millions of tons of waste are generated worldwide. Without proper sorting, valuable materials end up in landfills,
            recyclable items contaminate waste streams, and hazardous materials pose risks to our environment and health.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we sort waste correctly, we enable recycling programs to work effectively, reduce the burden on landfills,
            create compost from organic materials, and ensure dangerous substances are handled safely.
            This simple act has far-reaching benefits for our communities and planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            EcoSort makes this process easier by providing instant, accurate guidance on how to dispose of any item properly.
            Together, we can transform waste from a problem into a resource for building a sustainable future.
